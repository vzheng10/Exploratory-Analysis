## Exploratory Analysis of Maryland Police Stops, utilizing the Stanford Open Policing Project (MD State Patrol Data)
### Project 1: 
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate police stops in Maryland using the Stanford Open Policing Project (MD State Patrol Dataset). This data is particularly valuable as it illuminates trends in traffic stops, one of the most common interactions between law enforcement and the public. On an average day, over 50,000 drivers are stopped by police across the United States, amounting to nearly 20 million motorists annually. By examining this dataset, which includes detailed information on stops from December 2006 to March 2014 (a total of 3,587,052 recorded stops), I aimed to uncover potential disparities in policing practices, such as racial profiling or bias in search and arrest outcomes.

### Project 2:
Project 2 builds on top of Project 1. I built an interactive webpage by using Shiny to analyze the Stanford Open Policing Project (MD State Patrol Dataset). The webpage provides additional visualizations, enhanced with interactivity to explore relationships and trends.
